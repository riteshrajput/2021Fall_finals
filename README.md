## Background:

* “Asian Americans have long been subjected to bias in the United States. But anti-Asian bias attacks have taken a more violent turn since COVID became a reality for Americans under a president bent on scapegoating Asians for the pandemic.”

* The rise in Asian hate crimes witnessed across the United States reinforce a sense of heightened vulnerability among them and the reports indicate 3,800 incidents of anti-Asian bias over the last year since the world witnessed the COVID 19 pandemic. The statements made by the former President from calling the COVID 19 virus as the ‘China Virus’ or ‘Kung Flu’ can be considered as the icing on the cake when it came to the rise in such hate crimes across the United States. Fast Forward in 2021 we see the new president Joe Biden passing the COVID 19 hate crimes act (Legislation bill) with an overwhelming support from both chambers of the congress in order to curb such hate crimes against the Asians during the pandemic era. 

* In order to dig deep into these scenarios and to analyze the general and political effects of them on the Anti-Asian hate crimes, we have come up with the following Hypothesis:


*   Hypothesis 1 - Instances of Anti-Asian Hate crimes has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic.
*   Hypothesis 2- Higher unemployment rate in a particular state is directly proportional to higher anti-asian hate crime rates.
*   Hypothesis 3 - Population density of different races(WHITE,BLACK,ASIANS and HISPANIC) in a particular state have no correlation with the occurrence of Anti-Asian Hate crimes.

The data source used for the project is from the official government agency – “FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR)” which serves as the national repository for crime data voluntarily collected and submitted by law enforcement. The Hate Crime Statistics Data Collection provides information on crimes motivated by offenders’ bias against race, gender, gender identity, religion, disability, sexual orientation, and ethnicity. These data are also collected via NIBRS.
